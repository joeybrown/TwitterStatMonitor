This is a program that will monitor Tweets from the Stream Sample API (aobut 1% of tweets at any given time)

Requirements:
# Python 3 (better unicode support)
# Rename Variables_example.py to Variables.py and fill in the keys & secrets and adjust any other variables. Get your 2 Twitter keys from dev.twitter.com
# Redis server running (you can specify the port in Variables.py)

Let me know if you've got any problems, and feel free to submit a pull request!
